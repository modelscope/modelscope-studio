# Fragment

A fragment component that does not participate in page layout itself. Its main purpose is to combine multiple child components and wrap them together as a `modelscope_studio` component.

> Some component slots only support components exported from `modelscope_studio`. If you need to insert other components, you'll need to wrap them with the `Fragment` component.

## Examples

<demo name="basic"></demo>
