`modelscope_studio` is a third-party component library based on Gradio, offers developers more customized interface building capabilities and a richer variety of component usage forms.

Currently supported UI libraries:

- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

## When to Use

Compared to the original components of Gradio, `modelscope_studio` focuses more on page layout and component flexibility. If you want to build a more beautiful user interface, we highly recommend using `modelscope_studio`.

However, when your application needs Gradio to handle more built-in data on the Python side, the components of `modelscope_studio` may not be the best choice, but don't worry, it integrates well with existing Gradio components, you can still use `modelscope_studio` to optimize your application.

## Dependencies

- Gradio >= 4.43.0

## Installation

```sh
pip install modelscope_studio
```

## Examples

<demo name="example"></demo>

## Migration to 1.0

If you have used the `modelscope_studio` component before and want to continue using it in the new version, you do not need to make any changes to the original component, just import `ms.Application` in the outer layer.

```python
import gradio as gr
import modelscope_studio.components.base as ms
import modelscope_studio.components.legacy as mgr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with ms.Application():
        mgr.Chatbot()

demo.launch()
```
