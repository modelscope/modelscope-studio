    24 Grids System.

    In the grid system, we define the frame outside the information area based on row and column, to ensure that every area can have stable arrangement.

    Following is a brief look at how it works:

    - Establish a set of column in the horizontal space defined by row (abbreviated col).
    - Your content elements should be placed directly in the col, and only col should be placed directly in row.
    - The column grid system is a value of 1-24 to represent its range spans. For example, three columns of equal width can be created by <Col span={8} />.
    - If the sum of col spans in a row are more than 24, then the overflowing col as a whole will start a new line arrangement.

    Our grid systems base on Flex layout to allow the elements within the parent to be aligned horizontally - left, center, right, wide arrangement, and decentralized arrangement. The Grid system also supports vertical alignment - top aligned, vertically centered, bottom-aligned. You can also define the order of elements by using order.

    Layout uses a 24 grid layout to define the width of each "box", but does not rigidly adhere to the grid layout.
