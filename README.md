`modelscope_studio` is a third-party component library based on Gradio, extending more components and usage forms on top of the original Gradio components.

Currently supported UI libraries:

- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

## When to Use

Compared to Gradio's own components, `modelscope_studio` focuses more on page layout and component flexibility. If you want to build a more beautiful user interface, we highly recommend using `modelscope_studio`.

However, when your application needs Gradio to handle more built-in data on the Python side, `modelscope_studio` may not be the best choice, but you can still use `modelscope_studio`'s layout and display components to help build your app.

## Dependencies

- Gradio >= 4.0

## Installation

> Currently, `modelscope_studio` version 1.0 is still under development. You can use the `beta` version in advance.

```sh
pip install modelscope_studio~=1.0.0b
```

## Quick Start

```python
import gradio as gr

import modelscope_studio.components.antd as antd
import modelscope_studio.components.base as ms

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with ms.Application():
        with antd.ConfigProvider():
            antd.DatePicker()

demo.queue().launch()
```

## Migration to 1.0

If you have used the `modelscope_studio` component before and want to continue using it in the new version, you do not need to make any changes to the original component, just import `ms.Application` in the outer layer.

```python
import gradio as gr
import modelscope_studio.components.base as ms
import modelscope_studio.components.legacy as mgr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with ms.Application():
        mgr.Chatbot()

demo.launch()
```
