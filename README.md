## When to Use

Compared to the original components of Gradio, `modelscope_studio` focuses more on page layout and component flexibility. If you want to build a more beautiful user interface, we highly recommend using `modelscope_studio`.

However, when your application needs Gradio to handle more built-in data on the Python side, the components of `modelscope_studio` may not be the best choice, but don't worry, it integrates well with existing Gradio components, you can still use `modelscope_studio` to optimize your application.

## Dependencies

- Gradio >= 4.43.0

## Installation

```sh
pip install modelscope_studio
```

## Quick Start
